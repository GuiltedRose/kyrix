# kyrix
This is a hobby project of mine.
## KyrixOS:

    Microkernel architecture -> this is for security. Minimizes the code ran by the kernel directly.

    TODO:
    * Figure out how to do EFI booting.
    * Learn more about microkernel & exokernel architectures.
    * Start implementing an x86_64 kernel.
    
    End-goal -> I want a bootable secure OS that's reasonably fast in comparison to modern systems.
